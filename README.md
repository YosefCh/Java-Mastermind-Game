# Mastermind Game

This is a Java implementation of the classic game of Mastermind. The game is a code-breaking game where the player has to guess a code of four colors. The player has 12 guesses to break the code.

## How to Play

1. The game will display a list of acceptable colors at each turn.
2. Each color should be entered separated by a space.
3. Input with misspelled colors, colors not in the list, or extra spaces will have to be reentered.
4. The game will provide feedback in the form of symbols after each guess:
    - **Black Peg**: Correct color at the correct spot.
    - **White Peg**: Correct color but in the wrong spot.
    - **Blank**: Color not in the code.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into several methods:

- `makeCode()`: This method generates a random code of four colors.
- `guessScore()`: This method takes the code and the user's guess as input and returns feedback in the form of symbols.
- `isValidGuess()`: This method checks if the user's input is valid.

## Running the Game

To run the game, simply compile and run the `mastermind.java` file. The game will prompt you for your guesses and provide feedback after each guess.

## Note on Terminal Output

This program uses ANSI color codes to colorize terminal output. These are widely supported in Unix-based terminals and Windows 10â€™s console, but may not display correctly in all environments. If you see unexpected characters in the output, try running the program in a different terminal or IDE. The same is true of the symbols used for the black and white feedback. The current implementation works on Eclipse.
